# wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack

The ``org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack`` Galleon feature-pack provisions a set of additional features allowing you to configure a WildFly server to work on the cloud. 
Its usage is not strictly required when provisioning a WildFly server for the cloud, but as the [detailed documentation](doc/index.md) describes, it brings to the server some configuration aspects that are generally expected in a cloud context (e.g.: Openshift or Kubernetes).

The ``org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-preview-galleon-pack`` to be used with the ``org.wildfly:wildfly-preview-feature-pack`` (that allows to provision Jakarta EE 9+ server) provisions the same set of additional features.
